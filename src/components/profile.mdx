<!-- I'm ambitious, self-driven, and enthusiastic about the future of the web. I currently work in Brooklyn, New York as a Senior Software Developer at Air, previously at IEX and Salesforce.com. Using the latest web technologies and languages, I strive to build beautifully designed and masterfully coded websites and apps. I continually learn from and contribute to the web community and constantly find myself taking on self-initiated [side projects](#projects). I merge the gap between designer and developer by taking my designs from pen and paper to usable, performance-first online experiences. -->
