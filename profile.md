# Hi, I'm Chris.

I create usable, responsive, future-friendly sites and apps with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js, PostCSS, Pug, Haml, Sass, BEM, OOCSS, RWD, Markdown, PHP, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, npm, Yarn, Jekyll, Vim, and Git.

I'm ambitious, self-driven, and enthusiastic about the future of the web. I currently work in New York City as a Front End Engineer at IEX, previously at Salesforce.com. Using the latest web technologies and languages, I strive to build beautifully designed and masterfully coded websites and apps. I continually learn from and contribute to the web community and constantly find myself taking on self-initiated [side projects](/projects). I merge the gap between designer and developer by taking my designs from pen and paper to usable, performance-first online experiences.
