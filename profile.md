# Hi, I'm Chris.

I create usable, future-proof websites with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Wordpress, and bits of PHP. An ambitious 27 year old enthusiastic about the future of the web, I currently work in New York as a Front End Engineer at Salesforce.com. I majored in graphic design and minored in Business at Samford University and am an AIGA member. Using the latest web technologies and languages, I strive to craft beautifully designed and masterfully coded websites. I've always been intrigued by the magic of web design and continually learn from and contribute to the web community. By merging the gap between designer and developer, I take my designs from pen and paper to hand-coded, usable online experiences.
